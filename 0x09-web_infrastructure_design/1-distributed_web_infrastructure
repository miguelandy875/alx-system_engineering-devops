On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.

Requirements:

You must add:
2 servers
1 web server (Nginx)
1 application server
1 load-balancer (HAproxy)
1 set of application files (your code base)
1 database (MySQL)
You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
For every additional element, why you are adding it
What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
Where are SPOF
Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
No monitoring
